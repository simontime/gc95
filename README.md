Tiger Game.com homebrew application to generate a Windows 95 CD Key

**TODO:**
- Properly document the code; most Game.com syscalls are publicly unknownâ€”it took me a ton of reverse engineering effort to figure out what they do.
- Document the build process; explain how to build the ROM and patch it to pass Game.com's security checks.
